                <h1>Hi, I'm Surabhi S V</h1>
                <p>

                    Hey there! I’m Surabhi S V, a passionate and driven Computer Science Engineering student with a
                    natural curiosity for emerging technologies. As someone who thrives on challenges, I bring a
                    combination of hard work, enthusiasm, and confidence to everything I do. Whether it's mastering new
                    coding languages or diving into innovative tech trends, I’m always eager to learn. When I’m not
                    immersed in the world of technology, you’ll find me exploring my creative side through singing,
                    dancing, or getting lost in a good book. I also love trekking and connecting with nature, which
                    gives me the perfect balance of focus and relaxation.
